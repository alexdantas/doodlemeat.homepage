    This game was made at our universitys local game jam called _Gotland Game Jam_.
    It was made in under 48 hours. The code is written in Javascript.

    We was 4 people working at this distributed by 1 designer, 1 programmer(me) and 2 artists. I used a HTML 5 javascript game framework called [JawsJS](http://jawsjs.com/).

  # This is an optional list of pictures:
  #
  # - If this is empty/doesn't exist, no thumbnail is shown
  # - If this only has a single element, will show both
  #   as thumbnail and on the full game description
  # - If this has more than one element, the first one will
  #   be the thumbnail and will make a slider of all images
  #   on the main game description.
