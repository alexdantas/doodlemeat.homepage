    This game was made at our universitys local game jam called _Gotland Game Jam_.
    It was made in under 48 hours. The code is written in Javascript.

    We was 4 people working at this distributed by 1 designer, 1 programmer(me) and 2 artists. I used a HTML 5 javascript game framework called [JawsJS](http://jawsjs.com/).

    I applied everything I learned from the university in this game. It was just made for fun.

    It features a man in a Borat bathsuit exploring a infinite generated dungeon. You can put up torches and swing in ropes and mine stone and minerals.

    It is made in C++ written in Visual Studio.
