    This game was made at our universitys local game jam called Gotland Game Jam. It was made in under 48 hours.
    The code is written in Javascript. We was 4 people working at this distributed by 1 designer, 1 programmer(me)
    and 2 artists. I used a HTML 5 javascript game framework called <a href="http://jawsjs.com/">JawsJS</a>
