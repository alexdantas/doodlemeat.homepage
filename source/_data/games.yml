    This game was made at our universitys local game jam called _Gotland Game Jam_.
    It was made in under 48 hours. The code is written in Javascript.

    We was 4 people working at this distributed by 1 designer, 1 programmer(me) and 2 artists. I used a HTML 5 javascript game framework called [JawsJS](http://jawsjs.com/).
